    "## Introduction\n",
    "Flask, a popular Python web framework, is widely used for building web applications and APIs. In this blog post, we'll explore the process of debugging a Flask API that provides stock information. The code snippet you've shared defines a Flask application with an API to search for stock information, add missing stocks to a database, and retrieve historical data. We'll walk through the debugging process using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and address any questions that may arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python and Flask: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine, and install Flask using pip if it's not already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visual Studio Code: Download and install VSCode, a lightweight and powerful code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging Setup\n",
    "1. **Open the project folder in VSCode:** Launch VSCode and open the folder containing your Flask project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Flask extensions:** VSCode has extensions that enhance Flask development. Install the \"Python\" and \"Flask\" extensions from the VSCode marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Flask environment:** Set up a virtual environment for your project using the integrated terminal in VSCode. Activate the virtual environment to ensure you're using the correct Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add breakpoints:** To start debugging, place breakpoints in your code by clicking in the left margin next to the line numbers where you want the debugger to pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging Steps\n",
    "Now, let's go through the debugging process step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Investigate the stock endpoint\n",
    "- Set a breakpoint inside the `search_stock` class's `post` method.\n",
    "- Send a POST request using Postman to the `/api/stock/search` endpoint.\n",
    "- Observe the variables, especially `symbol`, `api_key`, and the response from the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Handle potential exceptions\n",
    "- Examine the `try` and `except` blocks in the `search_stock` class. Are there specific exceptions being caught?\n",
    "- Use the VSCode debugger to step through the code and identify any issues with the FMP API response or the processing of stock information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Debug the missing stock addition\n",
    "- Set breakpoints inside the `stock` class's `put` method.\n",
    "- Send a PUT request using Postman to the `/api/stock/missingstock` endpoint.\n",
    "- Check the variables such as `symbol`, `company`, and `quantity`. Ensure the new stock is added to the SQLite database correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Address database and SQLAlchemy errors\n",
    "- Look for potential issues related to the SQLite database and SQLAlchemy. Check the `__init__.py` and other relevant files for any misconfigurations.\n",
    "- Examine the `except` block in the `stock` class to understand how database-related errors are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Investigate historical data retrieval\n",
    "- Set breakpoints inside the `HistoricalData` class's `post` method.\n",
    "- Send a POST request using Postman to the `/api/stock/historical` endpoint.\n",
    "- Inspect variables like `symbol`, `api_key`, and the response from the FMP API for historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Verify image conversion and response\n",
    "- Review the code related to creating and converting the historical data plot.\n",
    "- Confirm that the base64-encoded image is correctly returned in the API response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Debugging a Flask API involves a combination of setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and carefully observing the flow of execution. With the powerful debugging features of Visual Studio Code, you can efficiently identify and resolve issues in your code. As you progress through the debugging steps outlined in this post, feel free to ask any questions that arise during the process. Happy coding!\n"
