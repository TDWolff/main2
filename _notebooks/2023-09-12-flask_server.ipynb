    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.\n",
    "## Why Flask?\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to install Flask?\n",
    "Flask is a Python module and can be installed with pip. Install Flask using the command below:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install Flask\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use Flask?\n",
    "Flask is easy to use. You just need to import the Flask module and create an instance of the Flask class for your web app. Lets get started with  making your first Flask app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "Make sure your port # does not match your already open github pages port #. If it does, you will need to close the github pages server before running the flask server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: port # 4200 is the github pages port, if the flask is the same port it will not work so i would choose 5001 or a different port #."
