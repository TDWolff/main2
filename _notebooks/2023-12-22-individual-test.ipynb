    "## Question #’s  I Got Wrong:\n",
    "6\t16\t18\t20\t21\t22\t24\t30\t32\t36\t39\t41\t45\t50\t56\t58\t60\t62\t63\t64\t65\t66\t67\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6:\n",
    "The correct answer was C, I chose B because I didn’t think the quiz through enough, and if I had spent time going through the movements, I would have gotten it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 16:\n",
    "The answer was D, I chose A because I thought that A would increment the length as in count how many there were removed but I didn't read the code correctly so I messed up on that one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 18:\n",
    "Honestly, I just was plain stupid on this question, I chose A and the obvious answer was B, A just tells you to move into a wall if you can’t move which doesn’t make any sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 30:\n",
    "I followed the code with my digits and after reading it I had thought that it would not be able to say too low but I guess I didn’t try enough digits which would cause me to get that problem wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 39:\n",
    "Code segment shows \n",
    "```\n",
    "Line 1: i ← 1\n",
    "Line 2: sum ← 0\n",
    "Line 3: REPEAT UNTIL (i > 10)\n",
    "Line 4: {\n",
    "Line 5:    i ← i + 1\n",
    "Line 6:    sum ← sum + nums[i]\n",
    "Line 7: }\n",
    "Line 8: DISPLAY (sum)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "And I chose A because A says lines 1 and 2 should be interchanged but I guess I can see why 5 and 6 would be interchanged as 5 and 6 if you changed them would result in the intended outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 45:\n",
    "Correct answer D, I chose B because I thought that the random would be the results, and like if I had 3 then that meant 3 heads, and if I had 0 that would be all tails, and then if it was 3 or 0 then I won and if it wasn't I loose which isn't correct according to CB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 58:\n",
    "Correct answer C, for my answer which was A, the check for if x=y would be false, and the else would be false which makes the entire function return false which confuses me cause from what I interpreted from the question, it wants me to find which would return false and I did so that question I have questions for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 64:\n",
    "For this double question, I chose B and C but the right answer was B and D. This question is another example of why I should slow down and try each question instead of brute forcing it because if I had read through a little further I would have decided that B and D were the right answer. I need to slow down. This applies not just to this question but to the whole quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 67:\n",
    "I chose A and C, the answer was A and B. A is right because it causes the output to equal 1 when in actuality it should be 2 and B is the right answer because it causes the output to be 0 when it should be 1. Both of these show the flaw in the code's current configuration and if I spent more time and did the code in my head I would have gotten it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at my quiz results and reflections, it's clear I can do better next time. I didn’t spend a lot of time on each question to complete them as fast as possible. Next time, I'll slow down, take some time to understand each question, and not rush to answer. The coding questions, like Question 18, made me realize I should take more time on code questions and that It's not just about glances. Mistakes on questions like 30 and 39 showed me I need a lot more hands-on practice with code segments and purposely messing up. I should spend more time working through various scenarios to build up my skills and intuition.  Overall I need to consider slowing down, being extra careful with code, and practicing more will be my game plan for taking these quizzes next time.\n",
