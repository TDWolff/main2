    "I worked on a stock search algorithm where I provide vital information about a stock as seen in F1. This was done using the YahooFinance API which allowed me to find the current price of a stock found via the symbol and other necessary information such as EPS, PE, Average Volume, and Price Average over 50, and 200 days. I personally enjoyed making this feature because it allowed me to discover and learn about stocks which I enjoy researching.\n",
